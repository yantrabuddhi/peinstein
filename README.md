# PEusbMcu

Current situation with prof einstien to make control work
1. turn off P.E.(prof. Einstein)
2. reset the nodemcu
3. wait 5 sec
4. start P.E.
5. after P.E. tells you "now return to stienomatic to continue" wait a second
6. start scratch program or serial control (calls connect_tcp())

sending node.restart() may restart the nodemcu?
